# Activity: Using Hex Codes for Colors in CSS

## Introduction
Colors in CSS can be written as hex codes. For example, `#f5f5dc` is the same as 'beige.' Hex colors start with a `#` followed by numbers and letters. Since you'll see hex colors often, let's practice using them in a CodeSpace.

## Instructions

- [ ] **Fork the repository**
  - Fork this repository and go through the steps on how to open it in CodeSpaces. Use the document below if you need assistance. 
  - [Codespace Guidance Document](https://gist.github.com/JohnWP8253/4fff80f43d07a04ee3f1514c0a1d354a)

- [ ] **Open your CSS code:**
  - Locate the CSS file associated with your project.
   
- [ ] **Change the background color:**
  - Find the CSS rule that sets the background color of the `body` element to 'beige'.
  - Change the background color value from 'beige' to `#f5f5dc`. Your code should look like this:
    ```css
    body {
      background-color: #f5f5dc;
    }
    ```

- [ ] **View the changes in your browser:**
  - Save the CSS file and refresh your web page in the browser.
  - Done correctly, nothing should have changed because `#f5f5dc` and 'beige' are the exact same color.

## Conclusion
By completing this activity, you have practiced using hex codes to set colors in CSS. Understanding hex codes is essential as they are frequently used in web development.

Happy coding!
